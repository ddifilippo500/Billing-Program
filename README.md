Fall 2023 - Billing and Payroll Application

The culmination of four seperate programs that built upon one another to create a final billing module that takes user input for an employee then calculate if they worked any overtime hours before compiling the information into an Ad Hoc Report

In order to use properly please use the Menu Program that is attatched rather than the other files then input your data first using the Enter Billing Data Option before Displaying the Ad Hoc Report. 
However if you do not follow the steps above there are exceptions in place to prevent it from breaking.

The Menu program allows the user to tap into my other programs and to also reset the notepad file that will be created from my other programs. The second part of my program is the Billing Module which collects the input data, saves it into a brand new file, and then calculates the overtime worked and final pay for the employee. The third major piece being the Ad Hoc Report which displays the input data from the Billing Module.
